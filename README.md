# 🛎️ Daily Standup Bot

A simple Slack automation to make daily team updates effortless and async.  
Designed for cross-functional teams, remote setups, and busy managers who want clarity without chasing updates.

## 🚀 What It Does

Every day at **10:00 AM**, the bot sends a message to your team in Slack asking them to fill out a short form:

- ✅ What did you do yesterday?  
- 📌 What are your priorities for today?  
- 🚧 Any blockers?  
- 👤 Your name (auto-filled)

All responses are collected and sent to the **Daily Standup Bot**, where managers and teammates can easily view the updates.

### 💬 Schedule Calls if Needed

If someone mentions blockers or critical issues, the bot can prompt to schedule a quick sync or escalate for fast resolution.

## 💡 Why This Helps

- ✅ **Async-friendly**: No need to pull everyone into a call.
- 📋 **Transparency**: Everyone knows what others are working on.
- 🕒 **Fewer meetings**: Quick updates replace long check-ins.
- 👀 **Better visibility**: Managers get a single view of team progress.
- 🌐 **Cross-functional clarity**: Ideal for teams spread across roles or time zones.

- 🌙 **End-of-Day Updates** – What got done, what’s next
- 📥 **Manager Syncs** – Collated updates from all direct reports
